# Scenic

Scenic is a very simple, cloud-based photo hosting web application. The end state of Scenic is:

* Remain simple and straight forward;
* Never trade functionality for usability;
* Remain private but available;
* Keep users anonymous

Scenic 1.0 is designed with Rails 4 in mind. It requires standard ruby and rails dependencies, and currently uses postgresql as a database. However, you can replace postgresql with mysql.
